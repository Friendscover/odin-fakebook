# odin-fakebook

This is my take on the final project of the Rails track on the [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project). 

The web app is a clone of fakebook with most of the feature, that are present in the current facebook.
