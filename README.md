# odin-fakebook

This is my take on the final project of the Rails track on the [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project). 

The web app is a clone of fakebook with most of the feature, that are present in the current facebook.

# conclusion

So it has been quite a while since I started this project. There is still a few things, that have not been implemented, but the most important stuff ist done.

Things you can do include:
- Create/show posts
- Send/accept/delete friendrequests
- Login/logout
- See/update your profile
- Look at the Timeline with Posts of your friends

Things you can not do right now, but may be added at a later stage:
- Sign in with the real facebook
- Post an image instead of only text

# final thoughts

This project challenged all my current Ruby on Rails skills and I think the model creation and relation was the hardest part. Beforehand I did a mockup of the project, which was a huge help to understand model relations. The styling is super simple and I used Bulma CSS, which I did not use before. But hopefully I can improve my CSS Skills in the upcoming course on [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css).

Writing test for this project was challenging and my abilitites to wrtite good test are lacking. This is an area I need to improve on. 

If you wanna see the project in action, it is live at [Heroku!](https://murmuring-shore-45324.herokuapp.com/).
